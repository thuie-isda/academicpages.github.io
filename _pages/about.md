## Home
We focus on artificial intelligent technologies for system informatics and data analytics, with the objective to develop systematic analytical methodologies for effective inference and performance improvement for complex data. The methodologies comprise both theoretical and applied aspects of statistics and machine learning, including 
+ effective information extraction, online change detection and adaptive sampling for high dimensional structured data
+ system control, intelligent overall decision-making, and data fusion techniques with domain knowledge integration for industrial applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing and transportation systems. 

## Research Opportunities and Job Vacancy
*We are looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students, Postdoc, Research Assistants/Associates with strong math and coding background for machine learning research and industry-scale data science project. We are also recruiting undergraduate students who would like to be devoted to machine learning research in future. Interested applicants, please email your CV to:*
